"""The rsl-rl algorithm interface a custom ``Algo(cls=...)`` must satisfy.

rsl-rl's ``OnPolicyRunner`` is **not** hard-wired to PPO: it resolves the
algorithm class from ``cfg["algorithm"]["class_name"]`` (a class object or an
import path, via ``rsl_rl.utils.resolve_callable``) and drives whatever it gets
through a fixed rollout/update loop::

    alg_class = resolve_callable(cfg["algorithm"]["class_name"])   # PPO by default
    self.alg  = alg_class.construct_algorithm(obs, env, cfg, device)
    ...  self.alg.act(obs) / process_env_step(...) / compute_returns(obs) / update()

deepracer-genesis passes the class you give to ``Algo(cls=...)`` straight into
that slot (``spec_to_train_cfg`` — ``resolve_callable`` accepts a class object
directly, so even a notebook-defined class works), so a custom algorithm plugs
into the **same** runner PPO uses. It only has to speak this interface.

Easiest path — subclass ``rsl_rl.algorithms.PPO`` and override the learning rule
(``compute_returns`` / ``update``); you inherit ``construct_algorithm`` (which
builds the actor/critic/storage), ``act``, ``get_policy``, ``save``/``load`` and
the rest for free::

    from rsl_rl.algorithms import PPO

    class Reinforce(PPO):
        def compute_returns(self, obs): ...      # Monte-Carlo returns, no GAE
        def update(self): ...                    # policy-gradient loss

    run(MyExperiment, ...)   # with a stage:  >> Algo(cls=Reinforce)
